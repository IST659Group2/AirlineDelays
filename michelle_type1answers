## IST 687 - Final Project: Analysis of Airline Delays

```{r}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library()
```

####Importing the Data and Basic Data Exploration

Link to data: https://www.kaggle.com/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses/data

```{r}
#Importing the data
df <- read.csv("~/Syracuse/Coursework/IST 687 Intro to Data Science/DelayedFlights.csv")
```

```{r}
colnames(df)
```

```{r}
#X1 is just a duplicate column of the index so we can drop that
df$X1 <- NULL
colnames(df)
```

```{r}
head(df)
```

```{r}
summary(df)
```

####Data Cleaning

Remove 1st column "X"
```{r}
df <- df[,-1]
```

Create a Date column 
```{r}
df$date <- as.Date(ISOdate(df$Year, df$Month, df$DayofMonth, tz="EST"))
```

Change the value in Month column from num to factor
```{r}
df$Month <- with(data=df,
            ifelse((Month == 1),"January",
            ifelse((Month == 2),"February",
            ifelse((Month == 3),"March",
            ifelse((Month == 4),"April",
            ifelse((Month == 5),"May",
            ifelse((Month == 6),"June",
            ifelse((Month == 7),"July",
            ifelse((Month == 8),"August",
            ifelse((Month == 9),"September",
            ifelse((Month == 10),"October",
            ifelse((Month == 11),"November","December"))))))))))))
```

Change DayOfWeek from num to factor
```{r}
df$DayOfWeek <- with(data=df,
                ifelse ((DayOfWeek == 1),"Monday",
                    ifelse((DayOfWeek == 2),"Tuesday",
                      ifelse((DayOfWeek == 3),"Wednesday",
                        ifelse((DayOfWeek == 4),"Thursday",
                          ifelse((DayOfWeek == 5),"Friday",
                            ifelse((DayOfWeek == 6),"Saturday","Sunday")))))))
```

Want to check for missing values in our most important data points (ArrDelay and DepDelay).
```{r}
sum(is.na(df$ArrDelay))
```

I want to explore these data points with missing data a little more. 
```{r}
head(df[is.na(df$ArrDelay)==TRUE,])
```

This seems like a small enough number of missing values that it is ok to just remove these rows. 
```{r}
df_clean <- df[complete.cases(df$ArrDelay),]
head(df_clean)
```

```{r}
sum(is.na(df$DepDelay))
```

####Type 1 Data Questions

What Airline experiences the most/longest delays?

```{r}
#let's see what airlines we have data on
unique(df_clean$UniqueCarrier)
```

This dataset uses unique carrier codes. A full list of these codes and the airlines affiliated with them can be found here: https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/reference/codes/aircarrier/acname.txt

```{r}
#want to see how many flights each carrier has
a <- table(df_clean$UniqueCarrier)
b <- as.data.frame(a)
colnames(b)[1] <- "Airline"
colnames(b)[2] <- "Flights"
b$percentTotal <- round(b$Flights/sum(b$Flights),digits=4)*100
b[order(-b$Flights),]
```

We can see that WN (Southwest Airlines Co.) has the most flights (19.5% of total). In tallying delay frequencies, we should make sure to account for them having more total flights than other airlines. 

First, let's explore the delay data a little quickly before subsetting by airline. 

```{r}
ggplot(df_clean, aes(x=ArrDelay))+geom_histogram(fill="blue",bins=30)
```

Can already quickly see that there are outliers in the data. 

```{r}
ggplot(df_clean)+geom_boxplot(aes(x=factor(0),y=ArrDelay))
```

We can notice that there are a lot of outliers for the delays. Let's begin looking at this by airlines. 

```{r}
ggplot(df_clean, aes(x=UniqueCarrier,y=ArrDelay))+geom_boxplot(aes(color=UniqueCarrier),alpha=.5,method="jitter")
```

```{r}
c <- tapply(df_clean$ArrDelay,df_clean$UniqueCarrier,mean)
avgDelay <- mean(df_clean$ArrDelay)
avgDelayCarrier <- as.data.frame(as.table(c))
colnames(avgDelayCarrier)[1] <- "Airline"
colnames(avgDelayCarrier)[2] <- "avgAirlineDelay"
avgDelayCarrier$overallAvgDelay <- avgDelay
avgDelayCarrier$diffFromAvg <- avgDelayCarrier$avgAirlineDelay - avgDelayCarrier$overallAvgDelay
avgDelayCarrier <- avgDelayCarrier[order(-avgDelayCarrier$avgAirlineDelay),]
rownames(avgDelayCarrier) <- NULL
avgDelayCarrier
```

From this, it appears that YV (Mesa Airlines, Inc.) has the longest avgDelay at 55.29 minutes. The airline with the shortest delays was AQ (not found) that had the average delay length at 21.26 minutes. 

```{r}
ggplot(avgDelayCarrier,aes(x=Airline,y=diffFromAvg)) + geom_bar(aes(fill=diffFromAvg),color="black",stat="identity") + scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue",high="red")
```

####Type 1 Data Question

What is the average length of a delay?
```{r}
#first, factor out early arrivals by changing negative numbers in $ArrDelay to 0 so that it does not falsely weigh down the average delay time.
only_delays <-df_clean #make a copy of clean data

only_delays$ArrDelay[only_delays$ArrDelay < 0] <-0

head(only_delays$ArrDelay, 20) #check new column

#calculate central tendancies

delay_mean<-mean(only_delays$ArrDelay[])
paste("mean - negatives:",delay_mean,sep="")

delay_mean<-mean(df_clean$ArrDelay)
paste("mean + negatives:",delay_mean,sep="")

delay_median<-median(only_delays$ArrDelay)
paste("median:",delay_median,sep="")

#install.packages("modeest") #package to calculate mode
library(modeest)

delay_mode<-mfv(df_clean$ArrDelay) #using df_clean for mode to factor out increased population of 0
paste("mode:",delay_mode,sep="")


```
It was surprising to see that the average length of delay did not change that much when computing with the original early arrival numbers. 

All in all, the average length of a delay is about 42 minutes long. However, airline delays are most commonly only 10 minutes long. The median of this data set is 24 minutes. 


#### Type 1 Data Question
How frequently do delays occur (for specific airlines)?

```{r}
#create new data frame 
df_delays <- data.frame(only_delays$UniqueCarrier, only_delays$ArrDelay)
names(df_delays)<-c("UniqueCarrier","ArrDelay")
head(df_delays,25)

```

```{r}
#subset out any rows with 0 to eliminate flights that were not delayed
df_delays <-df_delays[apply(df_delays[c(2)],1,function(y) !any(y==0)),]

head(df_delays, 25)
```
```{r}
counts<-table(df_delays$UniqueCarrier) #count the number of time an airline has a listed delay

counts[order(counts)] #order frequency by least to greatest

#visualize data
#preparing bar graph by ensuring labels fit neatly
par(las=2) #make labels perpendicular to axis
par(mar=c(5,8,4,2))

barplot(counts, main="Delay Frequency Distribution", xlab="Unique Carrier", cex.names=0.8)

```
Southwest Airlines delays most frequently, but there is a correlation with the amount of flights they have. American Airlines has the second most frequent delays.
